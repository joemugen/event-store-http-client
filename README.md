## Overview

Prooph Event Store HTTP Client supports communication via HTTP to [EventStore](https://eventstore.org/).

For usage in async event loop, use the [TCP Connection](https://github.com/prooph/event-store-client) instead.

## Installation

### Client

You can install prooph/event-store-http-client via composer by adding `"prooph/event-store-http-client": "dev-master"` as requirement to your composer.json.

### Server

Using docker:

```bash
docker run --name eventstore-node -it -p 2113:2113 -p 1113:1113 eventstore/eventstore
```

Please refer to the documentation of [eventstore.org](https://eventstore.org).

See [server section](https://eventstore.org/docs/server/index.html).

In the docker-folder you'll find three different docker-compose setups (single node, 3-node-cluster and 3-node-dns-cluster).

## Unit tests

Run the server with memory database

```console
./run-node.sh --run-projections=all --mem-db
```

```console
./vendor/bin/phpunit
```

Those are tests that only work against an empty database and can only be run manually.

Before next run, restart the server. This way you can always start with a clean server.
